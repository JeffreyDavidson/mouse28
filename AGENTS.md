# Mouse28 Agent Guidance

## Project

Mouse28 is a blog-first Disney parks and podcast site focused on accessibility,
autism awareness, family experiences, park tips, and related Disney content.

The homepage content order is:

1. Hero
2. Featured post
3. Latest posts
4. Guides teaser (only when `GUIDES_ENABLED=true`)
5. Podcast
6. About
7. Newsletter

## Stack

- PHP 8.5
- Laravel 13
- Filament 5
- Blade views
- Tailwind CSS 4 and Vite 7
- Pest-style tests run through Laravel's test command

The Vite entry points are `resources/css/app.css`,
`resources/css/filament/admin/theme.css`, and `resources/js/app.js`. The public
layout loads Tailwind and Alpine through Vite. The Filament entry point owns
admin design tokens and global panel overrides; custom admin Blade views use
the shared components in `resources/views/components/filament`. Keep frontend
work in the existing Vite pipeline and do not introduce a second toolchain.

## Model and reasoning policy

- Use GPT-5.6 Sol for Mouse28 work by default.
- Use medium reasoning for routine, clearly scoped slices.
- Use high reasoning for CI failures, architectural decisions, multi-file refactors, or unclear bugs.
- Use xhigh reasoning only when the task explicitly requests a deep audit.
- Do not change the model or reasoning level without explaining the change first.

## Git Workflow

- Use `develop` as the integration branch and `main` as the release branch. Reserve `development` for environment names, not new branch names.
- Create focused working branches from an up-to-date `develop`; do not commit feature work directly to `develop` or `main`.
- Do not add a `codex/` prefix to Mouse28 branches.
- Name working branches using the conventional `<type>/<short-description>` format: `feature/`, `feat/`, `fix/`, `hotfix/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`, `test/`, `chore/`, or `release/`.
- Keep descriptions lowercase, concise, and hyphen-separated. For example: `docs/boost-rules-and-docs-cleanup`.
- Squash merge feature, fix, refactor, chore, docs, and test branches into `develop` through pull requests.
- Squash merge `hotfix/` branches into `main`; merge `release/` branches into `main` with regular merge commits. Do not rebase-merge pull requests.
- Before merging, verify the pull request's head branch, base branch, and merge method.
- After a pull request is merged, verify `gh pr view` reports `MERGED` and record its head, base, and merge commit before cleanup. Fetch with `--prune`, inspect `git worktree list`, fast-forward the local base branch from its remote when clean, check out that base branch in the active worktree, and delete the local PR branch. GitHub's `gh pr merge --delete-branch` may merge successfully while failing its local checkout cleanup when the base branch belongs to another worktree; never treat that error as proof that the merge failed. If a clean temporary worktree blocks the base checkout, remove that temporary worktree first; never remove a worktree containing changes or an active branch. Squash merges may require `git branch -D` only after the recorded merged head and clean state have been verified. Never delete a checked-out branch or a branch attached to another active worktree.
- Every new commit must follow [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/): `type: description`, with an optional scope (`type(scope): description`) and optional breaking-change marker (`type(scope)!: description`).
- Use lowercase types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, or `revert`. Use `feat` for new features and `fix` for bug fixes; branch prefixes such as `feature/`, `hotfix/`, and `release/` are not commit types.
- Write a concise, imperative description. Mark breaking changes with `!` before the colon or a `BREAKING CHANGE: description` footer.
- Apply the same convention to pull request titles, squash commit subjects, and release or synchronization merge commit subjects; replace generated merge subjects when necessary (for example, `chore(release): release 2026.09.15`).
- Check the message before every commit and verify the final commit subject before merging a pull request. Do not rely on squash merging to excuse nonconforming feature-branch commits.
- Write pull request bodies as actual multiline Markdown. When using the GitHub CLI, prefer `--body-file` or a command input that preserves real newlines; never pass literal `\\n` sequences.
- Do not commit `.worktrees/` or changes belonging to another worktree.

## Application Structure

- `Post` is the primary blog content model.
- `Episode` contains podcast episodes.
- `Guide` contains accessibility resources.
- `Podcast::info()` provides the single-row podcast metadata record.
- Jeffrey, Cassie, or both may be credited as post authors.

Guides are dormant by default: `GUIDES_ENABLED=false` hides public guide routes
and discovery while retaining Filament management and authorized previews.
Transistor owns podcast audio hosting, the canonical RSS feed, and embedded
players. Mouse28 stores episode metadata, share URLs, show notes, and transcripts.

The main navigation contains Home, Blog, Podcast, About, and Contact. Preserve
the site's blog-first content hierarchy when changing public pages.

Community Stories are intentionally outside the product scope. Do not restore
reader-submitted story collection, moderation, or public story pages.

## Design System

- Navy: `#1a1040`
- Light navy: `#2d1b69`
- Purple: `#5b3e9e`
- Gold: `#d4a843`
- Cream: `#fef9ef`
- Dark cream: `#f5efe0`
- Heading font: Besley
- Body font: Poppins

Preserve semantic HTML, keyboard access, visible focus states, readable color
contrast, responsive layouts, 48-pixel mobile controls, and reduced-motion
support. Prefer Tailwind utilities and shared CSS tokens over new inline styles.
Keep dynamic Blade-derived colors in CSS custom properties when utilities cannot
represent them safely.

## Development and Verification

Inspect `composer.json` and `package.json` before running project commands. Use
`composer check` for the full local quality gate, including dependency audits,
formatting, static analysis, Rector, tests, type coverage, an asset build, and
Chromium browser smoke tests. It requires installed dependencies, Chromium, and
network access for audits. Both application and Pest static analysis run at
`level: max` and are required in CI; run `composer analyse:pest` for a focused
test-analysis check.

For small changes, run the relevant focused checks:

- `composer test`
- `npm run build`
- `git diff --check`

Use `composer test:lint` to check formatting or `composer lint` to apply fixes.
`composer test` excludes the separate `composer test:browser` suite.
Pint's enabled Blade formatter requires the locked Prettier packages.

`boost.json` tracks Boost-managed skills and selected integrations, including
Filament guidance and Nightwatch MCP setup. The Nightwatch preference does not
enable application monitoring or complete MCP authentication.

Use Herd for local HTTP serving and `npm run dev` when Vite's development server
is needed. Production and staging are hosted on Forge; follow
`docs/operations.md` for deployment work.

Use Pest syntax for new tests. Keep public routes renderable, preserve contact
form Turnstile and rate-limit protections, and never expose service secrets in
Blade, JavaScript, logs, fixtures, or documentation.

## Filament

Use APIs supported by the installed Filament 5 version. Keep custom admin styles
in Filament's supported theme pipeline, authorize protected actions server-side,
and add smoke coverage when introducing a Filament resource or registered page.

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to ensure the best experience when building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application running on PHP 8.5. You are an expert with the Laravel ecosystem. Always use the APIs that match the installed major version of each package — do not assume a version.

Before relying on a package's API, confirm its installed version:
- PHP packages: run `composer show --direct` to list direct dependencies with versions, or `composer show <vendor/package>` for a single package.
- JS packages: check `package.json` for the installed versions.

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Use `search-docs` before changes that depend on Laravel ecosystem APIs, behavior, configuration, or version-specific syntax. Skip it for copy-only edits and other changes where package documentation is irrelevant. Reuse sufficient results already in context instead of searching again.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Project Rules

- This project contains committed, area-grouped rules in `.ai/rules` when that directory exists (settled decisions, non-obvious traps, standing constraints). Framework and package guidelines that only apply to specific paths (testing, frontend, components) also live there, under `.ai/rules/boost` — this is not just recorded decisions, it is load-bearing guidance you have not seen inline. Before you enter plan mode or create/edit any file, you MUST first: open @.ai/rules/index.md (it maps file globs to rule files), read every rule file whose globs cover the path(s) in scope, and run `grep -rin 'keyword' .ai/rules` to catch what a path match alone misses. Do not write code until you have read and are following every matching rule. If `.ai/rules` does not exist, continue without it.
- Record durable rules with `record-rule` so the next agent or teammate inherits them instead of working them out again. Pass a `glob` (e.g. `app/Http/Controllers/**`), a short `title`, and a few-line `note`. Always use `record-rule`, never your native memory or notes tool — native memory is personal and session-scoped; only `.ai/rules` is shared with the team and persists in the repo.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== herd rules ===

# Laravel Herd

- The application is served by Laravel Herd at `https?://[kebab-case-project-dir].test`. Use the `get-absolute-url` tool to generate valid URLs. Never run commands to serve the site. It is always available.
- Use the `herd` CLI to manage services, PHP versions, and sites (e.g. `herd sites`, `herd services:start <service>`, `herd php:list`). Run `herd list` to discover all available commands.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- The `{name}` argument should not include the test suite directory. Use `php artisan make:test --pest SomeFeatureTest` instead of `php artisan make:test --pest Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.

=== laraveldaily/filacheck-pro/core rules ===

## laraveldaily/filacheck-pro

- After creating or modifying any files under `app/Filament/`, run `vendor/bin/filacheck --fix --dirty` to auto-fix deprecated Filament code and flag performance, security, UX, and best-practice issues from FilaCheck-Pro. `--dirty` limits the scan to files with uncommitted git changes — fastest after a targeted edit.
- Exit code 0 means no remaining issues; exit code 1 means violations remain after `--fix`. Any reported violation that `--fix` could not resolve MUST be addressed (consult the rule's suggestion message) before continuing the task.
